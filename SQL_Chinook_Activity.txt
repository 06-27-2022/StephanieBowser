SELECT "FirstName", "LastName", "InvoiceId", "InvoiceDate", "BillingCountry" FROM "Invoice"
FULL JOIN "Customer" ON
"Invoice"."CustomerId" = "Customer"."CustomerId"  WHERE "Country" = 'Brazil';

SELECT * FROM "Employee" WHERE "Title" = 'Sales Support Agent';

5) Provide a query showing a unique list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT "BillingCountry" FROM "Invoice" GROUP BY "BillingCountry";

6) Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resultant table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT "Employee"."LastName", "Employee"."FirstName",

"Employee"."LastName", "Employee"."FirstName" FROM "Invoice", "Customer", "Employee"
WHERE "Employee"."EmployeeId" = "SupportRepId";

8) How many Invoices were there in 2009 and 2011? What are the respective total sales for each of those years?
SELECT date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2009' FROM "Invoice"; 83
SELECT date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2011' FROM "Invoice"; 63
SELECT count(*) FROM "Invoice" WHERE date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2009' OR date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2011';

SELECT SUM("Total") FROM "Invoice" WHERE date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2009'; 449.46
SELECT SUM("Total") FROM "Invoice" WHERE date_part('year',"InvoiceDate") = '2011'; 469.58
SELECT SUM("Invoice"."Total") FROM "Invoice" WHERE
date_part('year', "InvoiceDate") = '2009' OR date_part('year', "InvoiceDate") = '2011'
GROUP BY date_part('year', "InvoiceDate");

9) Looking at the InvoiceLine table, provide a query that COUNTs the number of line items for Invoice ID 37.
